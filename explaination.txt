Explanation of Tools and Libraries:


1.Streamlit: A fast framework for building interactive web applications for data science and machine learning projects. It allows creating data-driven web apps in just a few lines of Python code.
  
2.DeepFace: A deep learning-based Python library used for facial emotion detection. It simplifies the process of analyzing emotions from images by applying pre-trained models for face recognition and emotion classification.

3.TextBlob: A text processing library that provides a simple API for performing common NLP tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase extraction, and sentiment analysis. It computes the polarity and subjectivity of a given text.

4.text2emotion: A lightweight package that helps detect emotions like happy, sad, angry, fear, and surprise from a given piece of text.

5.Plotly: A graphing library used to generate interactive and visually appealing plots and charts. In this app, it's used for rendering pie charts to visualize the distribution of emotions detected in text.

6.OpenCV: A powerful library for computer vision tasks. It's used in the app to read and manipulate images, including face detection.

7.Pillow: A Python Imaging Library (PIL) fork that simplifies image handling. It is used for opening and processing images in the app.

8.streamlit-option-menu: This library is used to add a navigation menu to the Streamlit app, allowing users to switch between different sections such as "Text" and "Image" analysis.
